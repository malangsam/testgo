<p>Barak told Deborah that he would only go if she went also. 5 And when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him Zacchaeus make haste and come down. Deborah would sit under a palm tree in the mountains and the Israelites would go to her. Most of us probably remember it from our Sunday School lessons and from that childrens song we all learned. But Sycamore actually is if it is seasoned well.

<p>The story of Zacchaeus is a very famous and familiar story in the Bible. Zacchaeus was a wee little man And a wee little man was he He climbed up in a sycamore tree For the Lord he wanted to see And as the Savior passed that way He looked up in that tree And He said Zacchaeus you come down. When I think of the sycamore tree I think of the old song we sang in Sunday school about Zacchaeus. For he was to pass that way. Barak told Deborah that he would only go if she went also.</p>
