<p>Students take their GCSE exams around age 16 in the last months of the academic year at school although preparation begins long before. The Government is committed to GCSE and A-level exams going ahead in England in summer 2022 with adaptations to take account of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on this years cohort. Three core subjects English maths and science are compulsory along with PSHE and PE although there are no exams in the latter two. This will have a huge impact on the private candidates for yet another year. This needs to be remembered and supported.</p>
