<p><strong>Oldest Tree In Nyc</strong>. Known as the Queens Giant the 450-year-old 134-foot Tulip Poplar tree in Alley Pond Park Queens is the tallest and oldest tree in NYC. Take a trip through Alley Pond Park and you might come across a tulip tree that was 134 feet when last measured in 2005. Conventional wisdom with all its caveats and contradictions currently holds that the oldest may be the enormous tulip tree in Alley Pond Park. Workers uncovered hundreds of upright stumps of the 385 million-year-old tree more than a century ago after a flash flood in Gilboa New York uncovered them but little else was known about the trees appearance.</p>
