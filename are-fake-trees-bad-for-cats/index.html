<p>If your cat does manage to take a chunk out of your fake tree the plastic could cause choking an obstruction in your cats digestive tract or poisoning. Ingesting pine needles can cause liver damage or even death according to cat behavior expert Marilyn Krieger. Do not allow them to touch it. I start my DIY projects by constructing a wooden armature to give structure then I attaché then carve sheets or blocks of foam that are then covered with a paper pulpparticle clay. A nimble careful cat may climb the tree in perfect safety but just to be on.</p>
