While there is no single right way to set up a nativity scene certain details tend to cross regional and cultural divides. Many of the round door hangerssignswreaths whatever you want to call them are wood and are selling for 50-60 on Etsy. Often entire families come together to partake in the experience.</p>

<p>For the holidays remove it and use that wall space to hang small picture frames in the shape of a Christmas tree. Which means its time to get your DIY on and wow your family and friends with the most spectacular Christmas ever. The before photo was from last years porch and although it looked fine I felt that the real greenery I added this year just takes it up a notch. From DIY Christmas ornaments to Christmas Mason jars there are tons of dollar tree Christmas craft ideas to make for adults and even kids. Nothing says Christmas like visiting your favorite Christmas tree farm and picking out a tree.</p>

<p>For the holidays remove it and use that wall space to hang small picture frames in the shape of a Christmas tree. Choosing just one to take home can be hard and if your beautifully decorated tree leaves you inspired to decorate two or three more youre not alone. You can hang them on walls or across a mantel. The before photo was from last years porch and although it looked fine I felt that the real greenery I added this year just takes it up a notch. So I thought a round Christmas sign would be perfect for that location.</p>

<p>It would have taken me a long time and significantly more greenery and cost to make a garland that long but by using the existing faux garland I already had a good base. No Christmas tree would be complete this year without a little Olaf Frozen magic. The tree is sturdy I was able to hang some ornaments the red Christmas ball is pretty and was tucked safely inside the blue blanket the music is loud and plays the Peanuts soundtrack doesnt go on and on but it isnt very short either and the height is just right for me. The before photo was from last years porch and although it looked fine I felt that the real greenery I added this year just takes it up a notch. I thought about making a new scroll for Christmas but I wanted to use some buffalo check fabric that I got from Dollar Tree.</p>
