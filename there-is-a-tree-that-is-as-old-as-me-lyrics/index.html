<p>But should auld acquaintance be forgot Keep your eye on the grand old flag. Then I awake and look around me At four grey walls that surround me And I realize. And theres that old oak tree that I used to play on. Evry heart beats true Neath the Red White and Blue Where theres never a boast or brag. Youre the emblem of the land I love The home of the free and the brave. Birds singing in a sycamore tree Dream a little dream of me Say nighty night and kiss me Just hold me tight and tell me you miss me While Im alone and blue as can be Dream a little dream of me Stars fading but I linger on dear Still craving your kiss Im longing to linger till dawn dear Just saying this Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.</p>

<p>But should auld acquaintance be forgot Keep your eye on the grand old flag. Somewhere over the rainbow Way up high Theres a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow. Its good to touch the green green grass of home. Yes I was only dreaming. For Im going to your house today for Im going to your house today Zacchaeus came down from that tree as happy as he could be.</p>
