<p>The nights are so clear. Its Christmas in New York again. Here we go caroling The Saint Pattys nativity Is something everyone should see It even makes the Grinch believe Central Park looks beautiful in white Central Park looks beautiful in white Cuddled up beneath a blanket taking in the sights The City is all red and green Wrapped up like a gift for me Finally its Christmas in New York No theres nothing better We should all have. Its Christmas in New York again. Christmas time is coming through the air Trees and lights and presents meant to share A gift is almost anything Its the joy that love can bring Its the smile on faces everywhere Lets light up the windows after dark Build a funny snowman in the park And hear the children caroling Making magic as they sing All I want for. Giving us hope and helping us through.</p>

<p>Giving us hope and helping us through. It was Christmas Eve babe In the drunk tank An old man said to me wont see another one And then he sang a song The Rare Old Mountain Dew I turned my face away And dreamed about you Got on a lucky one Came in eighteen to one Ive got a feeling This years for me and you So happy Christmas I love you baby. Christmas time is coming through the air Trees and lights and presents meant to share A gift is almost anything Its the joy that love can bring Its the smile on faces everywhere Lets light up the windows after dark Build a funny snowman in the park And hear the children caroling Making magic as they sing All I want for. Children gaze with fascination they just cant wait til its dark. Bless the guys in the hardhats removing debris.</p>

<p>Snowflakes falling New Yorks calling. Verse 1 What do you feel like doing today Is it snow Will it snow Will it keep on raining so. Sleigh rides through Central Park snowmen capturing hearts. I dont own this song All hows to rightful owners. Features Song Lyrics for José Felicianos Christmas In New York album.</p>

<p>And theres snow in the air. Suddenly its Christmas in New York Chorus Find me on Broadway or at the ballet Ooh And Im five years old again Ooh Making my wish list but all I wish is Ooh-ooh For another Christmas in. Holiday in New York Lyrics New York is always hummin The excitements always here But theres something special comin Weve been waiting for all year All around Grand Central Station Smell the holly in the air Along Broadway theres a wreath on every door Slick hotels hang silver bells We got chestnuts in Time Square. Giving their sweat and their tears and their lives. Looking in through frosted windows finally here all together.</p>
