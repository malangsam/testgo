<p>Sunday Shoes carved in stone Lining the walls of your grandmothers home And in many ways theyve remained the same Since the day her. There a lot to be learned so look around. Chorus There is a tree beyond the world In its ancient roots a song is curled Im the fool whose lifes been spent Between whats said and what is meant I didnt mean what went so wrong Some things I wish I didnt know Ive always lived inside my head And often utterly alone I will be a pillow for your head You can make me promises you cant keep And Ill believe each word youve said. There Is a Tree lyrics - Carrie Newcomer Last night I dreamt you very near Though the night was dark beyond the glass. And what I heard there in the dark Are the secrets I will never tell. Think hell move that rubber tree plant.</p>
