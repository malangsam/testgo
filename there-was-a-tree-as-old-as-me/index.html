<p>There is a tree as old as me Branches were sewn by the color of green Ground had arose and passed its knees By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top I climbed the tree to see the world When the gusts came around to blow me down I held on as tightly as you held onto me I held on as tightly as you held onto me And I built a home For you. Standing there majestically Tree and me. In fact the Methuselah tree is the oldest tree on the planet. There is a tree as old as me Branches were sewn by the color of green Ground had arose and passed its knees By the cracks of the skin I climbed to the top I climbed the tree to see the world When the gusts came around to blow me down I held on as tightly as you held onto me I held on as tightly as you held onto me And I built a home For you. The tree was cored by Edmund Schulman in the late 1950s but he did not have a chance to date his sample before he passed away in 1958.</p>
