A pair of thieves broke into some storage units at Storage By the Sea early last month in the Lanier Plaza absconding with approximately 25000 in scuba diving equipment and other valuables according to a Brunswick Police report. Lights up beautifully but the white flocking has all but disappeared possibly because I store the tree in attic where it gets very hot in summer no basements here in South. Yep 18 years old. But the loot was of little profit until the culprits could find a place to dump it in exchange for cash.</p>
