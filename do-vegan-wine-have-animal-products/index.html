If wines are left to develop completely naturally they will usually self-fine reducing the need to introduce animal products into the process. Eggs casein gelatin and isinglass are common wine fining agents.</p>

<p>This process is used to remove protein yeast cloudiness off flavors and colorings and other organic particles. Wineries will sometimes claim that their wine is vegan. So the wines dont really have animal products in them. Hence now there are non-animal products that are added to the wine to get rid of the tannins and improve the color texture and taste. The Vegan Vine does not use any animal products in wine production.</p>

<p>We have been making vegan wines since 2017 but our wines were labelled vegan only in 2019 since the new FSSAI labelling norms came in force. The thing to remember though is that those proteins dont remain in the wine. Some people use bentonite which is a kind of clay and would make the wine vegetarian. With the rise of veganism along with an increased desire for organic and biodynamic wines winemakers across the world are taking note and adopting a more natural approach. Vegan fining might yet become the go-to process in traditional winemaking.</p>
