<p>The trees are important for survival for humans and animals alike. This is the Tree. A lyrical poetic and informative look at life on the African Plain and the lives which surround the Baobob tree. The baobab is a prehistoric species which predates both mankind and the splitting of the continents over 200 million years ago. Another story goes that when God was planting trees on earth he asked the animals to help him and gave every animal a tree to plant.</p>
