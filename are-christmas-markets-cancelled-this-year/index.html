<p>Organisers say recruitment issues caused. Last year the Budapest Christmas Market was canceled with the aim of inhibiting the spread of the coronavirus. Mulhouse Christmas market night canceled. In fact many Christmas markets last year were only cancelled a few weeks prior. It had been scheduled to open November 26 through December 24 after canceling in 2020.</p>
