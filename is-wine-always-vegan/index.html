<p><strong>Is Wine Always Vegan</strong>. The majority of people are unaware that wine although made from grapes may have been made using animal-derived products. In the clarification process of the wine in addition to filtering the liquid a substance is added to make the process more efficient. The latter is the dried swim bladder of the beluga sturgeon. Wineries have long used natural and organic animal proteins such as isinglass albumin casein gelatin and chitin to remove impurities and sediment from wines.</p>

However many people who adhere to a vegan diet refrain from consuming any food or drink that is processed using animal products as well as the animal products themselves.

Being from Bordeaux it would be silly for us not to be able to taste good vegan wine. This process is used to remove protein yeast cloudiness off flavors and colorings and other organic particles.

<p>Wine is made from grapes but that does not necessarily make it vegetarian or vegan. Wine bars and retailers have started to market some wines as vegan friendly in response to the growth of veganism in several countries.
